With a couple hours of 2022 left, I thought I'd slip a post in under the wire, just so there would be something showing up for this year.

I've quoted it a few times: writing is a muscle that needs exercising. Like real exercise, I find it much easier said than done.

Looking back at 2022, I can see all sorts of reasons why not much has happened here. My day job is particularly time consuming and I made a very conscious decision to spend less time sat on the sofa with the laptop out in the evenings.

Looking ahead to 2023, I'm going to try to find a better balance. I have a growing list of side projects and hobbies I want to dedicate some time to.

But that's enough for now.

If I've sprung up unexpectedly in your RSS feed reader, than I'm happy that's all still working. Happy New Year and all that.
